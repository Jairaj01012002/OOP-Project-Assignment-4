Delivery executive oop solution
This project is the solution of executive delivery problem. The problem has been solved in python language.
First of all I have used two data structure, one dictionary to coontains information regarding executive members currently working.
Second is a stack that will help us in assigning task to the executive member.
If the executive id in not present then we would print that it doesn't exist.
